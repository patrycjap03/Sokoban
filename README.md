Implementation of a console application that allows Sokoban gameplay . The application in its complete form form allows you to play several simple, consecutive stages. Each stage is evaluated in terms of the number of moves made, which is subtracted from some fixed value (the number of available moves) coded for that stage of the game. If the player finds that further gameplay no longer makes sense, he can restart the current stage. An automatic restart will occur also when the player has used up the entire pool of moves available for a given stage. In addition, from any any stage of the game it is also always possible to go to the start menu, where one can: - exit the game, - start a new game from the first stage, In addition, the player can undo and redo moves so undone.
